<section><title>Where do I ask questions which are not answered in this FAQ?</title>
<p>
	In most cases, the best place is the <em>erlang-questions</em>
	mailing list at <url href="mailto:erlang-questions@erlang.org">
	erlang-questions@erlang.org</url>. Anyone can
	<url href="http://www.erlang.org/mailman/listinfo">subscribe.</url>

<section><title>The answer to question 2.4 is wrong!</title>
<p>
	If you've found an editorial error in the FAQ (broken link,
	an addition to a list of links, typo, ambiguity, badly 
	expressed answer, etc.), send some mail to
	<url href="mailto:matthias@corelatus.com">
	matthias@corelatus.com</url> and I'll fix it.
</p>
	<p>

	Problems along the lines of "the advice about
	the importance of type checking is complete drivel" might
	be of general interest on the <em>erlang-questions</em> 
	mailing list at <url 
	href="mailto:erlang-questions@erlang.org?subject=besserwisser">
	erlang-questions@erlang.org</url>.
